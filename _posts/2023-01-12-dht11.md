# How to connect a DHT11 to Home Assistant (Container)

I struggle a few weeks trying to understand how to connect a thermometer (DHT11/22) to a Raspberry Pi, and a few more on how to read the sensor values on Home Assistant (running in the same RPI on a container -AKA "non-managed HA"-). 

In order for me to remember I decided to write this post. It was a fun process that lead me to learn how to use queue services (mosquito-mq) and also how hard can it be to send and receive data from different services (if you don't know what you are doing)

I do no longer run Home Assistant in a container, but I think this process already teach me how to do it for other sensors/controllers that might not be supported out-of-the-box. -and other external services- 

So stay tune for this no-so-easy to follow tutorial on how connect the DHT11/22 thermometer to Home Assistant -the hard way-.

## Instructions 

1. First we will need to connect the DHT sensor to the RPI via RPI-GPIO. There is plenty of tutorials online, so you can use the one that fits you the best. I can recommend these two: 

    - [This is the one I use][3] 
    - And [here is another one][4] more structured


    ![rpi](rpi_dht11.png){:h='400'}

    Once that everything is working (hopefully) you will be able to read the values from the sensor using a python script. This is a checkpoint to test for the status of: RPI, connection, and sensor.

2. Install Home Assistant on a container using [the docs][2]
    <!-- markdownlint-disable -->
    >  I use the container install because **I have other things and services running on my RPI**. Home Assistant strongly suggest you to use the ["supervised envirorment installation"][9]. This instructions are for people like me that for some reason don't want to dedicate the entire RPI for HA. If you are like me, this tutorial is for you.
    {: .prompt-info }
    <!-- markdownlint-restore -->
  
   ![rpi](rpi_ha_diag.svg){:h='400'}

3. There are a [few ways][5] that might work to directly do the connection with the DHT11 using [HACS][6] you can [install][7] manually [a repo][8]. But they didn't work (for me). So at the end, reading this [reddit-topic][10] and [this tutorial][1] that "the easiest" way was via an MQTT service. Let's diagram this mess. 

    As you will soon understand, running the Home Assistant on a Container [successfully isolate][18] the app with the RPI SO, (where your sensors are located). This was recently enforced by [removing GPIO + Sensors support][11] (keeping a ["remote GPIO control"][15]  for "other" RPI). I kind of understand the reasoning behind that, but it is a PITA for the people that want to make use of their RPI. 

    The workaround its messy, but at the same time more "robust" -it is a more scalable and resilient solution-.  
    
    ![rpi](rpi_MQTT_diag.png){:h='480'}


    The diagram illustrates the various services that are in place for this system. 
    
    **The technical explanation**: The first service is a data collector service [MQTT-IO][12], which is running on a Raspberry Pi (RPI). This service collects data and then sends it (post) to an MQTT broker topic ([MosquitoMQTT][13]). The home assistant subsequently subscribes to the MQTT broker topic by utilizing the [MQTT integration service][14]. The messages that are received on each topic are then configured as sensors, allowing for the monitoring and tracking of various data points.

    **The human explanation**: given that our HA is super isolated running on his docker I can't know what is happening on the hardware connected to RPI, so we need a way to share data with the HA. How can we do that ? we can use a "messenger", AKA "message broker". This message broker is nothing more than a always-running-process that will receive messages, for example: sensor readings, and it will forward them to any subscriber for that "topic". So that what we will put in place: 

    1. "The message generator": a service that will be reading the GPIO that will send messages to the broker [MQTT-IO][12]
    2. "The message broker" (or "data collector"): a "message queue service" always running that will receive and forward the readings [MosquitoMQTT][13]
    3. "The message subscriber": an integration service running on the HA that will subscribe to the broker to read the sensor readings  [MQTT Service][14]

    let's deep dive on how to configure each one of this services: 

4. Let's set-up the MQTT-IO services -the message generator, sensor reader-, to do that we just need to install MQTT-IO in our environment or directly on the base env (easiest but not always a good idea). 
    
    ```bash
    pip3 install mqtt-io
    ```

    After that we create a `config.yml` this file will provide the sensor configurations and the address of the broker (not installed yet) and some other properties

    ```yaml
    mqtt:
        
        # this will be the address broker, this can be a local service (like in this tutorial)
        # or an online one
        host: localhost 

        # this is the topic prefix, this can be customized based on the 
        # sensors added to this process 
        topic_prefix: home 


    #DHT11 sensor configuration
    sensor_modules:
    - name: dht11_sensor
        module: dht22
        type: dht11
        pin: 17 # this may change if you add additional sensors or don't use pin 4 from above

    # queues configuration
    sensor_inputs:
    - name: temperature
        module: dht11_sensor
        digits: 2
        interval: 5
        type: temperature

    - name: humidity
        module: dht11_sensor
        digits: 2
        interval: 5
        type: humidity
    ```

    we will save this file on a location and before running it we will start the broker on the PI so we will have a queue where to storage the messages.

5. now we will configure the message broker (AKA mosquitto-mq). You can follow [this guide][13] that contains some authentication and validation steps, also it contains some snippet to test if the service is working. but if you are asking for the TLDR this are the steps:

    run 

    ```bash
    sudo apt-get update

    sudo apt-get upgrade
    ```
    
    Install mosquitto
    
    ```bash
    sudo apt-get install mosquitto

    sudo apt-get install mosquitto-clients
    ```
    
    Enable mosquitto service 
    
        sudo systemctl enable mosquitto
    
    After that the mosquitto service should be running on the local host, to start, stop or restart the service use the following commands 

    ```bash
    sudo systemctl start mosquitto

    sudo systemctl stop mosquitto

    sudo systemctl restart mosquitto
    ```

6. Now we are able to send the messages from the DHT11 to the broker, we can start "the sender" service running the following command:

        python3 -m mqtt_io config.yml
    
it should show you a log like the following one (in this case I have other sensors but should be similar)

    ![rpi](rpi_mqttio_running.png){:h='250'}

    That means that you are sending the messages to the broker. 

7. [Optional] you can run this capture service in the background and restart when rebooting, you can follow [these steps][16]. For my case what worked was [crontab][17]
    
        crontab -e 

    Add this line:

        @reboot cd ~/<my_config_directory>; python3 -u -m mqtt_io config.yml >> nohup.log & 

    I change directory and just to save the logs on the directory of my config, so I can debug if everything is working properly. You can test that the sensor is posting data running 

        mosquitto_sub -h localhost -p 1883 -t home/sensor/+ -v

    it should output something like this:

        toor@raspberrypi:~ $ mosquitto_sub -h localhost -p 1883 -t home/sensor/+ -v
        home/sensor/temperature 27.00
        home/sensor/humidity 25.00
        home/sensor/temperature 27.00
        ...
    
    you can also open the service to be accessible on the local network using the following configuration

        sudo nano /etc/mosquitto/mosquitto.conf

    then adding the following lines at the end of the config file
        
        listener 1883
        allow_anonymous true
        
    to setup a user/key follow the [tutorial][13]

8. To finalize we should configure "the listener" service. The idea is that we will now launch a service on the Home Assistant that will be subscribed to the broker. To do that we add the [`MQQT` integration][14]. We follow [the instructions][14]. We use `localhost` as the address, and `1883` as the port (the default one)

    ![rpi](rpi_mqtt_settings.png){:h='290'}

    Then we modify the `configuration.yaml` of the Home assistant installation to add the sensors from the queues of the broker. We add this on the bottom of the file.

    ```yaml
    # DHT sensor
    mqtt:
    sensor:
        - name: "Temperature"
        state_topic: "home/sensor/temperature"
        unit_of_measurement: "°C"
        force_update: true


        - name: "Humidity"
        state_topic: "home/sensor/humidity"
        unit_of_measurement: "%"
        force_update: true
    ```

9. [Optional] Adding filters. There is a known issue that the DHT sensor can have misreadings from time to time (its a cheap sensor, don't expect much). but you can improve the data adding this simple filters on the HA interface. 
    
    ![rpi](rpi_filter_sensor.png){:h='220'}

    We use the [filter integration][19]. There are several filters that we can stack on top of the signal, I use [outlier][20] and [moving average][21] you can configure your parameters based on your needs. 

    ```yaml
    # DHT11 added filtered
    sensor:
    - platform: filter
        name: "filtered humidity"
        entity_id: sensor.humidity
        filters:
        - filter: outlier
            window_size: 10
            radius: 2.0
        - filter: time_simple_moving_average
            window_size: "00:01"

    - platform: filter
        name: "filtered temperature"
        entity_id: sensor.temperature
        filters:
        - filter: outlier
            window_size: 10
            radius: 2.0
        - filter: time_simple_moving_average
            window_size: "00:01"
    ```

That's it, hopefully this helps someone to learn a little more about GPIO/HA/MQTT/RPI/Sensors :)
