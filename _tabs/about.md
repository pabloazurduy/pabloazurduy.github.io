## 👋 About Me 

Hi there! My name is Pablo Azurduy 😄. I have a MSc in Operations Research and I'm currently a Data Scientist at Uber 🚗 (based in Amsterdam 🇳🇱). 

I started my career as a Data Scientist at Walmart Chile 🛒 (6 years ago) and then at Latam Airlines ✈️. My focus was mostly on Optimization (Linear Optimization) some prediction and ML problems 📈. Most of the problems that I've worked so far can be framed on the [predict-then-optimize][2] family. 

At Uber, my major task has been on incentives and promotions optimization, algorithms for promotions, experimentation, and [Causal Inference][3] to understand the effects of promotions and how to optimize over them 📊. 

My interests are in [Bayesian Inference][4], [Causal Inference][3], and Optimization 🤓. Mainly because of my OR formation and because of my work experience. I'm always trying to learn new tools and improve on the skills that I have 💪. 

I develop most of my projects in Python 🐍 and SQL 🗃️, and I've learned to develop better software over time, which I think is something that our discipline often lacks 🤔. 

I'd love to collaborate, and very occasionally I've had the opportunity to [contribute][1] to open-source projects, such as [python-mip][5] 🤝. 

I enjoy sharing and talking about the topics that I find interesting, so I created this place to talk about Causal Inference, Data Science in general, Optimization, and from time to time other topics that might be relevant and interesting to me 🤩.
