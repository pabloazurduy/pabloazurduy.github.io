I started to writing notes, to myself, while I was studying to help me remember things later, my memory has never been particularly good. Now, I'm trying to keep writing them but sharing with a broader audience, just because, maybe someone finds them useful too. 

The idea of this blog is to share this notes with more people, they are mainly related with Data Science, [Bayesian Inference][4], [Causal Inference][3], Optimization, among others.
