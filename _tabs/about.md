## 👋 About Me 


Hi there! I'm Pablo, MS in Operations Research and currently Data Scientist at Uber. 

![Pablo Azurduy Avatar](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24685386?v=4){: w="240" .right }

I do a bit of "everything", but lately I've been more focused on Causal Inference and Experimentation. I studied OR, hence, I try to stay as close as possible to Optimization. However, there's no perfect job, as a consequence, being a "generalist" was my path to survive. I try to keep myself studying every week, and that's one of the reasons why I start writing these notes.

## About this blog 

My memory has never been particularly good, so I started to writing notes to help me remember things. Now I'm sharing some publicly, just because, maybe, someone finds them useful too.

The topics of this blog are; Data Science, [Bayesian Inference][4], [Causal Inference][3], Optimization, and anything other thing that I'm interested about. I'm ~~involuntary~~ a "generalist".
